# A contribution guide to WordCollector repositories

## Welcome, and thank you

ðŸ¥° We're very glad that you're interested in joining the WordCollector team, and contributing to open-source projects.

You are welcome to contribute in a number of ways:

- Code, in the form of requesting pull requests of forks into main repository branches.
- Documentation of code.
- Reports, in the form of filing issues on Github, whether that's a request for new functionality or a bug report.

## Code of Conduct

WordCollector does not have its own code of conduct, so â€“ for the time being â€“ we ask that members adhere to the [Flutter Code of Conduct](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and instead directly contact [vxern](mailto:vxern@wordcollector.co.uk) if you do not feel welcome in the community.
